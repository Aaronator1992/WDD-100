<h1>Uber: Above and Beyond</h1>
<p> The company that I worked for which is a shared ride networking company that uses an app that requests, not hails an Uber driver.<br> the payment system works, so that a person only uses the electronic app instead of cash. however, the person can chose to tip the driver based on how the driver interacted with the person. <br>
</p>
<p>
There is a two way rating system in the app that provides intel to the uber company on how the driver is interacting with the passenger and the passenger with the driver.<br> both have a level of expectation, and if the person driving acts a little weird, the passenger notices and rates accordingly.<br> I learned that talking to the passenger does help with the rating.
</p>
    <h2> Uber rating system</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 5 star rating system</li>
        <li> Both the driver and the rider rate each other</li>
        <li> sometimes the rider tips the driver</li>
    </ul>
